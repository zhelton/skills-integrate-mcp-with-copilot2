| POST   | `/activities/{activity_name}/signup?email=student@mergington.edu` | Register a student (teacher auth required)                          |
| DELETE | `/activities/{activity_name}/unregister?email=student@mergington.edu` | Unregister a student (teacher auth required)                   |

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.

## Teacher Credentials

Teacher usernames/passwords are stored in [teachers.json](teachers.json) and loaded by the backend.
